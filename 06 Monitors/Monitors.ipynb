    "\n",
    "While the motivation for monitors, combining mutual exclusion with encapsulation in a syntactic construct, is appealing, the details are intricate:\n",
    "- to the queue of threads trying to enter the monitor and the queues for each of the condition variables, one can add another queue of threads that were waiting and are ready to continue. Then, in total five different signalling disciplines are possible!\n",
    "- the problem of nested monitor calls can also be solved by making a call to another monitor within a monitor an _open call,_ meaning that the exclusive lock to the first monitor is released during the call. We have assumed (Java, Pthreads) that calls are _closed calls._ If calls are open, then the monitor invariant has to be established before each call.\n",
    "- mutual exclusion is not always necessary to ensure the integrity (invariant) of the monitor; strict mutual exclusion may affect performance unnecessarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "These issues have lead to numerous variants of monitors over the years. Some of those deviate even further. For example, [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/threading/thread-synchronization) has a `lock` construct that is similar to Java's `synchronized`. Synchronization is performed by _events_ which are explicitly set and cleared in two different ways:\n",
    "- `AutoResetEvent`: an event remains _signalled_ until a call to `WaitOne`, when the event is _unsignalled,_\n",
    "- `ManualResetEvent`: an event remains _signalled_ until it is explicitly reset.\n"
